To solve the quadratic equation \(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\), I can use factoring. 

First, I need to find two numbers that multiply to give the constant term (6) and add up to the coefficient of the linear term (5). These numbers are 2 and 3.

Next, I'll factor the quadratic expression by splitting the middle term:
\(x^2 + 2x + 3x + 6\).

Then, I'll group the terms into two binomials:
\((x + 2)(x + 3)\).

Finally, I'll set each binomial equal to zero and solve for \(x\) to find the solutions.

To solve the quadratic equation:

\[ x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0 \]

we can use **factoring**. Here's a step-by-step solution:

### Step 1: Factor the Quadratic Equation
We need to express the left-hand side as a product of two binomials.

\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + \_\_)(x + \_\_)
\]

To find the numbers that fill in the blanks, look for two numbers that:
- **Multiply** to give \(6\) (the constant term).
- **Add** up to \(5\) (the coefficient of the linear term).

The numbers \(2\) and \(3\) satisfy these conditions because:
\[
2 \times 3 = 6 \quad \text{and} \quad 2 + 3 = 5
\]

### Step 2: Write the Factored Form
Using the identified numbers, we can write:

\[
x^2 + 5x + 6 = (x + 2)(x + 3)
\]

### Step 3: Apply the Zero Product Property
Set each factor equal to zero and solve for \(x\):

\[
(x + 2) = 0 \quad \text{or} \quad (x + 3) = 0
\]

Solving these equations gives:

\[
x = -2 \quad \text{or} \quad x = -3
\]

### Final Solutions

\[
\boxed{x = -2 \quad \text{and} \quad x = -3}
\]
